=== Declaration ===
<pre>
#include <pgm/pgm.h>

struct pgm_pgmccinfo_t {
        uint32_t       ack_bo_ivl;
        uint32_t       ack_c;           /`*` constant C `*`/
        uint32_t       ack_c_p;         /`*` constant C,,p,, `*`/
        };
</pre>

=== Purpose ===
Settings for PGM Congestion Control (PGMCC)

=== Remarks ===
The following parameters of PGMCC are fixed values:

  * <tt>ssthresh</tt>, slow-start threshold to slowly probe the network to determine its available capacity.  Setting is currently 4 packets as per PGMCC draft recommendations.
  * Packet loss is assumed after _3 duplicate ACKs_.
