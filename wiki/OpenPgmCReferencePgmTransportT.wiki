=== Declaration ===
<tt>typedef struct pgm_transport_t '''pgm_transport_t''';</tt>

=== Purpose ===
A transport object represents a delivery mechanism for messages.

=== Remarks ===
A transport describes a carrier mechanism for messages across a network.

Programs must explicitly destroy each transport object. Destroying a transport object invalidates subsequent send calls on that transport, invalidates any listeners using that transport, and frees its storage.
