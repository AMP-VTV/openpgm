_Type_
=== Declaration ===
<pre>
#include <pgm/pgm.h>

typedef struct pgm_transport_t *pgm_transport_t*;
</pre>

=== Purpose ===
A transport object represents a delivery mechanism for messages.

=== Remarks ===
A transport describes a carrier mechanism for messages across a network.

Programs must explicitly destroy each transport object. Destroying a transport object invalidates subsequent send calls on that transport, invalidates any listeners using that transport, and frees its storage.
