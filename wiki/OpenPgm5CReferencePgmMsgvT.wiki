#include <pgm/pgm.h>

#define PGM_MAX_FRAGMENTS 16

typedef struct pgm_msgv_t *pgm_msgv_t*;

struct pgm_msgv_t {
	size_t                msgv_len;                        /`*` number of elements in msgv_skb `*`/
	struct [OpenPgm5CReferencePgmSkBuffT pgm_sk_buff_t]`*` msgv_skb`[`PGM_MAX_FRAGMENTS`]`;     /`*` PGM socket buffer array `*`/
};
</pre>

=== Purpose ===
A scatter/gather message vector^2^.

=== Remarks ===
Received messages from a transport can be a populated scatter/gather vector. APDU arrays are owned by the transport object, and the TPDU buffers are owned by the receive window and both will be recycled on the next call.
