<tt>int '''pgm_async_create''' (</tt><br>
: <tt>[[OpenPGM C Reference/pgm_async_t|pgm_async_t]]**     async,</tt><br>
: <tt>[[OpenPGM C Reference/pgm_transport_t|pgm_transport_t]]*     transport,</tt><br>
: <tt>int                        preallocate</tt><br>
: <tt>);</tt>

=== Purpose ===
Create an asynchronous event handler.

=== Remarks ===
APDUs are stored in an asynchronous queue using event objects, the <tt>preallocate</tt> parameter is used to set the initial number of these objects to keep in the trash stack.

=== Parameters ===

<td>The PGM transport object.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>preallocate</tt></td>
<td>Number of event objects.</td>

=== Return Value ===
On success, 0 is returned.  On invalid arguments, a critical message is logged and <tt>-EINVAL</tt> is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and <tt>errno</tt> is set appropriately.
