=== Declaration ===
<tt>typedef struct pgm_msgv_t '''pgm_msgv_t''';</tt><br>
<tt>struct pgm_msgv_t {</tt><br>
: <tt>[[OpenPGM C Reference/pgm_tsi_t|pgm_tsi_t]]*      msgv_tsi;       /* TSI */</tt><br>
: <tt>struct iovec*   msgv_iov;       /* scatter/gather array */</tt><br>
: <tt>size_t          msgv_iovlen;    /* # elements in iov */</tt><br>
<tt>};</tt>

=== Purpose ===
A scatter/gather message vector.

=== Remarks ===
Received messages from a transport can be a populated scatter/gather vector.  APDU arrays are owned by the transport object, and the TPDU buffers are owned by the receive window and both will be recycled on the next call.
