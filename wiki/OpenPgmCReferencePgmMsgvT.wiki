typedef struct pgm_msgv_t pgm_msgv_t*;

struct pgm_msgv_t {
	[OpenPgmCReferencePgmTsiT pgm_tsi_t]`*`      msgv_tsi;       /`*` TSI `*`/
	struct iovec`*`   msgv_iov;       /`*` scatter/gather array `*`/
	size_t          msgv_iovlen;    /`*` # elements in iov `*`/
	};
</pre>

=== Purpose ===
A scatter/gather message vector.

=== Remarks ===
Received messages from a transport can be a populated scatter/gather vector.  APDU arrays are owned by the transport object, and the TPDU buffers are owned by the receive window and both will be recycled on the next call.
