== 1998 January == 
  * _Pretty Good Multicast_, original draft <[http://www.tools.ietf.org/html/draft-speakman-pgm-spec-00 draft-speakman-pgm-spec-00.txt]>
  * Draft 1 <[http://www.tools.ietf.org/html/draft-speakman-pgm-spec-01 draft-speakman-pgm-spec-01.txt]>

<pre>

</pre>

== 1998 August ==
  * Draft 2 <[http://www.tools.ietf.org/html/draft-speakman-pgm-spec-02 draft-speakman-pgm-spec-02.txt]>

<pre>
      This revision benefited from general discussions in the forum of
      the Reliable Multicast IRTF as well as from individual discussion
      with Dan Leshchiner concerning source addressing and NAK elimina-
      tion, with Chetan Rai concerning outgoing packet ordering and
      local retransmission, and with Jim Gemmell, Luigi Rizzo, and
      Lorenzo Vicisano concerning FEC.
 
      Clarified that RDATA from DLRs and NCFs from network elements MUST
      bear the ODATA source's network-header source address.
 
      Added NAK elimination timer and corresponding procedures to net-
      work elements.
 
      Added procedures and packet formats to incorporate FEC.
 
      Changed all the packet type encodings to anticipate versioning and
      extension.
 
      Added work-in-progress items for RDATA delay at the source and
      minimum NAK back-off at receivers.
 
      Added work-in-progress items for SPMRs.
</pre>

== 1999 June ==
  * Draft 3 <[http://www.tools.ietf.org/html/draft-speakman-pgm-spec-03 draft-speakman-pgm-spec-03.txt]>

<pre>
      The polling and implosion control procedures in this document were
      developed jointly with Jim Gemmell.  The work on SPMRs arose from
      discussions with Dan Leshchiner.
 
      Removed range NAKs for re-working.
 
      Generalized and simplified methods for advancing transmit window.
 
      Removed increment sequence number from SPM packets.
 
      Removed Appendix B's information for congestion avoidance.
 
      Removed "local retransmission" in favor of full DLR functionality.
 
      Added generic polling capability within a single PGM hop.
 
      Added procedures to adjust NAK_BO_IVL dynamically and to address
      potential NAK implosion problems.
 
      Added SPMR procedures and packet formats.

== 2000 April ==
  * Draft 4 <[http://www.tools.ietf.org/html/draft-speakman-pgm-spec-04 draft-speakman-pgm-spec-04.txt]>

<pre>
      Introduced NAK lists.
 
      Revised DLR procedures to include off-tree DLRs.
 
      Revised description of NAK procedures.
 
      Changed TPDU length in packet formats to TSDU length.
 
      Swap of SQN and TRAIL fields in ODATA/RDATA header formats.
 
      Removed RSN TSN Appendix (formerly Appendix C).
 
      Added FIN/SYN/RST support
 
      Defined SPM NLA = 0 to mean that no path information is present.
 
      Defined SPM_TRAIL/LEAD values when no windowing information is
      present.
 
      Rationalized the option number space. Note to implementors: this
      is a significant change, so make sure your options have the right
      numbers in the right order.
 
      Moved the bulk of the Transmit Window information to Appendix F.
 
      OPT_VAR_SIZE became OPT_VAR_PKTLEN, a more descriptive and useful
      name.

  * Cisco release IOS 12.1(1)T with PGM Host support (''defunct'') <[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_1t/12_1t1/feature/guide/dtpgmhst.html PGM Host]>

== 2000 August ==
  * TIBCO announced it has delivered open source code <[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/12-04-2000/0001378267&EDATE= PGM Open Source Program]>

== 2000 November ==
  * Draft 5 <[http://www.tools.ietf.org/html/draft-speakman-pgm-spec-05 draft-speakman-pgm-spec-05.txt]>

<pre>
      Added the specification allowing the combined use of fragmentation
      and FEC.
 
      Changed the text in the FEC appendix to disallow receivers to send
      selective NAKs when parity is available (in the "SHOULD NOT"
      form).
 
      Changed the text that deals with prioritization of packet
      transmission at the source.
 
      Lower-case "must", "should" .. etc changed to upper-case where
      needed.
 
      Added an "Intellectual Property" disclaimer.
 
      Fixed the packet format of OPT_FRAGMENT.
 
      Fixed some typos and minor inconsistencies.

== 2001 February ==
  * Draft 6 <[http://www.tools.ietf.org/html/draft-speakman-pgm-spec-06 draft-speakman-pgm-spec-06.txt]>

<pre>
      To accommodate very small transmit windows, relaxed the require-
      ment that SPMs be sent at least at the rate at which the transmit
      window is advanced.
 
      Deleted the recommendation that a source SHOULD transmit RDATA at
      priority over concurrent ODATA.
 
      Changed the use of multicast NAKs from a recommendation to an
      option.
 
      Revised the text throughout to prohibit selective NAKs in FEC ses-
      sion except for the leading partial transmission block.
 
      To accommodate shortening a transmission group after the transmis-
      sion of the last data packet, relaxed the requirement that
      OPT_CURR_TGSIZE be appended to the last data packet in a shortened
      group.
 
      Revised the procedures for handling fragments in an FEC session.
 
      Added rounds and their application to the polling procedures.
 
      Removed the option of setting SPM_PATH to zero.
