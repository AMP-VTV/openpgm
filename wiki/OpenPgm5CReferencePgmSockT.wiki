_Type_
=== Declaration ===
<pre>
#include <pgm/pgm.h>

typedef struct pgm_sock_t *pgm_sock_t*;
</pre>

=== Purpose ===
A PGM socket object represents a delivery mechanism for messages.

=== Remarks ===
A PGM socket describes a carrier mechanism for messages across a network.

Programs must explicitly destroy each transport object. Destroying a PGM socket object invalidates subsequent send calls on that transport, invalidates any listeners using that transport, and frees its storage.
