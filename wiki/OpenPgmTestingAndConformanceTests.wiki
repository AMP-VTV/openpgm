=== 3.6.2.1.a. Sending ODATA packet ===

; Test : <tt>[https://forgesvn1.novell.com/viewsvn/openpgm/trunk/openpgm/pgm/test/odata.pl odata.pl]</tt>

; Overview : Send one data packet from the application and confirm delivery on the network.

; Pseudo code :
 app: create transport
 for (''i'' = 1..1000) {
   app: send ''i''
   mon: wait for ODATA: ''i''
 }
