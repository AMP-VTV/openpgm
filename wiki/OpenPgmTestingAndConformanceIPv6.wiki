* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Link-local_addresses_and_zone_indices Zone Indices] are not completely supported in interface parsing.

If you bridge an IPv6 interface on two different networks, i.e. using VLAN tagging, both interfaces will keep the same IPv6 link-local address, e.g.

 eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:30:1b:b7:a2:09  
           inet6 addr: fe80::230:1bff:feb7:a209/64 Scope:Link
 
 eth0.615  Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:30:1b:b7:a2:09  
           inet6 addr: fe80::230:1bff:feb7:a209/64 Scope:Link

Zone indices would allow the user to specify the adapter by index on Windows platforms, e.g.

 $ pgmsend -n "fe80::230:1bff:feb7:a209%2" moo
 $ pgmsend -n "fe80::230:1bff:feb7:a209%3" baa

Or the interface name on Unix platforms, e.g.

 $ pgmsend -n "fe80::230:1bff:feb7:a209%eth0" moo
 $ pgmsend -n "fe80::230:1bff:feb7:a209%eth0.615" baa

The interface index can be seen running <tt>dumpif</tt>

 Pgm-Message: #1 name lo (lo)         IPv6 ::1
 Pgm-Message: #2 name eth0 (eth0)     IPv6 fe80::230:1bff:feb7:a209
 Pgm-Message: #3 name eth0.615 (eth0. IPv6 fe80::230:1bff:feb7:a209

OpenPGM provides the ability to specify the interface as part of the network parameter but not the scope, similarly a multicast address must be specified if a dual protocol stack is enabled.

 $ pgmsend -n "eth0" moo
 $ pgmsend -n "eth0.615" baa

or

 $ pgmsend -n "eth0;ff08::1" moo
 $ pgmsend -n "eth0.615;ff08::1" baa
