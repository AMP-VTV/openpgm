_Function_
=== Declaration ===
<pre>
#include <pgm/pgm.h>

bool *pgm_getaddrinfo* (
	const char`*`                  restrict network,
	const struct [OpenPgm5CReferencePgmAddrInfoT pgm_addrinfo_t]`*` restrict hints,
	struct [OpenPgm5CReferencePgmAddrInfoT pgm_addrinfo_t]`*``*`      restrict res,
	[OpenPgm5CReferencePgmErrorT pgm_error_t]`*``*`                restrict error
	);

void *pgm_freeaddrinfo* (
	struct [OpenPgm5CReferencePgmAddrInfoT pgm_addrinfo_t]`*`   res
	);
</pre>

=== Purpose ===
Decompose a string network specification.

=== Remarks ===
The TIBCO Rendezvous network parameter provides a convenient compact representation of the complicated data structures needed to specify sending and receiving interfaces and multicast addresses.  This function provides conversion between the network string and the <tt>struct group_req</tt> parameters of <tt>[OpenPgm5CReferencePgmGetSockOpt pgm_setsockopt()]</tt>.

The returned <tt>[OpenPgm5CReferencePgmAddrInfoT pgm_addrinfo_t]</tt> must be freed with <tt>pgm_freeaddrinfo()</tt>.

=== Parameters ===

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>network</tt></td>
<td>A TIBCO Rendezvous compatible network parameter string</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>hints</tt></td>
<td>Transport info structure whose <tt>ai_family</tt> specify criteria that limit the set of addresses returned by <tt>pgm_getaddrinfo()</tt>.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>res</tt></td>
<td>return location for resolved transport info structure.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>error</tt></td>
<td>return location for error.</td>
</tr>
</table>


=== Return Value ===
On success, <tt>true</tt> is returned.  On failure, <tt>false</tt> is returned and if <tt>error</tt> is set it may be populated with details of the exception.


=== Errors ===

*PGM_ERROR_DOMAIN_IF, PGM_ERROR_INVAL,*
  * _"'%c' is not a valid character."_
    * Valid hostnames must conform to RFC 952, i.e. contain '`a`'-'`z`', `0`-`9`, a hyphen '`-`' or period '`.`'.  Valid IPv4 addresses can contain `0`-`9`, a period '`.`' and a forward slash '`/`' for CIDR blocks.  Valid IPv6 addresses can in addition contain a colon '`:`' and square brackets '`[`', '`]`'.  IPv6 addressing with zones may in addition contain percent mark '`%`' and underscore '`_`'.
  * _"Send group list contains more than one entity."_
    * PGM cannot simultaneously send to more than one group.
  * _"Unresolvable receive group %s%s%s"_

*PGM_ERROR_DOMAIN_IF, PGM_ERROR_XDEV,*
  * _"Expecting network interface address, found IPv4 multicast network %s%s%s"_
  * _"Expecting network interface address, found IPv6 multicast network %s%s%s"_
  * _"Expecting interface address, found IPv4 multicast address %s%s%s"_
  * _"Expecting interface address, found IPv6 multicast address %s%s%s"_
  * _"Expecting interface address, found IPv4 multicast name %s%s%s"_
  * _"Expecting interface address, found IPv6 multicast name %s%s%s"_
  * _"Network name %s%s%s resolves to IPv4 mulicast address."_
  * _"Network name %s%s%s resolves to IPv6 mulicast address."_

*PGM_ERROR_DOMAIN_IF, PGM_ERROR_NODEV,*
  * _"IP address family conflict when resolving network name %s%s%s, found AF_INET when AF_INET6 expected."_
  * _"IP address family conflict when resolving network name %s%s%s, found AF_INET6 when AF_INET expected."_
  * _"IP address family conflict when resolving network name %s%s%s, found IPv4 when IPv6 expected."_
  * _"IP address family conflict when resolving network name %s%s%s, found IPv6 when IPv4 expected."_
  * _"Not configured for IPv6 network name support, %s%s%s is an IPv6 network name."_
  * _"IP address class conflict when resolving network name %s%s%s, expected IPv4 multicast."_
  * _"IP address class conflict when resolving network name %s%s%s, expected IPv6 multicast."_
  * _"Network name resolves to non-internet protocol address family %s%s%s"_
  * _"No matching non-loopback and multicast capable network interface %s%s%s"_

*PGM_ERROR_DOMAIN_IF, PGM_ERROR_NOTUNIQ,*
  * _"Multiple interfaces found with network address %s."_
  * _"Network interface name not unique %s%s%s"_
    * PGM cannot simultaneously send to more than one group.

*PGM_ERROR_DOMAIN_IF,*
  * _"Numeric host resolution: %s(%d)"_
  * _"Internet host resolution: %s(%d)"_
  * _"Resolving receive group: %s(%d)"_
    * Platform specific error.


=== Example ===
Basic example using default hints.
{{{
 char* network = "eth0;226.0.0.1";
 struct pgm_addrinfo_t* res = NULL;
 pgm_error_t* err = NULL;
 
 if (!pgm_getaddrinfo (network, NULL, &res, &err)) {
   fprintf (stderr, "Parsing network parameter: %s\n", (err && err->message) ? err->message : "(null)");
   pgm_error_free (err);
   return EXIT_FAILURE;
 }
}}}
